# Aniket Kangutkar's First CS193 Homework
My favorite things about CS 193 are:

- The nonexistence of any midterms or final
- The requirement for an A being a 90%+ instead of 93%+
- No purchases necessary for the class
- The sense of humor inserted in the powerpoint presentations
- The emphasis of being active in the lectures(taking in class quizzes), thus ensuring we're paying attention
